## Project Experience

### Generative Intelligent Agent for Mathematics Knowledge in Middle School
**Tsinghua University** Institute for AI Industry Research Winter Research Project (2024.12 - 2025.05) (Beijing, China)  
Supervisor: <a href="https://yuanchun-li.github.io/" target="_blank">Yuanchun Li</a>

As **Project Leader**, constructed a generative intelligent agent (EZYer), with core functions divided into three modules (Teacher Module, Student Module, Controller): The Teacher Module supports one-click generation of LaTeX Beamer lecture notes compliant with the Chinese high school mathematics curriculum, allowing users to customize the insertion of images; The Student Module dynamically generates structured learning notes through multi-role collaborative interaction between "teacher - teaching assistant - top student - struggling student - note taker"; The Controller is responsible for content review of uploaded and generated content to ensure compliance with user requirements.

- Paper "EZYer: A simulacrum of high school with generative agent" has been accepted by AgentIR (SIGIR 2025 Workshop) as first author and corresponding author
