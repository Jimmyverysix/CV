As **Project Leader**, constructed a generative intelligent agent (EZYer), with core functions divided into three modules (Teacher Module, Student Module, Controller): The Teacher Module supports one-click generation of LaTeX Beamer lecture notes compliant with the Chinese high school mathematics curriculum, allowing users to customize the insertion of images; The Student Module dynamically generates structured learning notes through multi-role collaborative interaction between "teacher - teaching assistant - top student - struggling student - note taker"; The Controller is responsible for content review of uploaded and generated content to ensure compliance with user requirements.

- Paper "EZYer: A simulacrum of high school with generative agent" has been accepted by AgentIR (SIGIR 2025 Workshop) as first author and corresponding author
